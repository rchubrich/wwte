r1 = Restaurant.create(:name => 'Delfina', :locu_id => 'ad4f19b42cb9b1d61336', :phone => '4155524055', :opentableurl => 'http://delfinasf.com/restaurant/reservations', :url => 'http://www.delfinasf.com', :address => '3621 18th St. San Francisco, CA 94110', :description => "One night in college I dreamt of fish at Delfina. Taking it as a message from a higher power, I went up to the city that night for dinner, and lo, there it was on the menu, a whole roasted branzino with a Meyer lemon relish, and I proceeded to have one of the most satisfying meals of my life. \n \nYou see, Delfina is literally the stuff dreams are made of. Since it opened in 1998, the first yuppie outpost on a then-sleepy block on 18th St., Delfina has made the Mission hospitable to gentrified life and set the standard for Italian food in San Francisco. You must always begin with one of Delfina's seasonal Bellinis--made with peach in the summer, pomegranate in the fall, and blood orange in the winter, it is the San Francisco aperitif par excellence. The rest is up to you (follow your dreams!), but even the carbophobes among us are strongly advised to try one of their house-made pastas, and be warned that their buttermilk panna cotta is truly sublime and will ruin you for any other. During white truffle season in November, they hold a series of dinners featuring fresh truffles flown in from Italy that elevate their exquisite pastas straight to heaven.")
r2 = Restaurant.create(:name => 'NOPA', :locu_id => 'daea756ba298a8fa8ad5', :phone => '4158648643', :opentableurl => 'http://www.opentable.com/nopa-san-francisco', :url => 'http://www.nopasf.com', :address => '560 Divisadero St. San Francisco, CA 94117', :description => "Open daily till 1am, NOPA is the late-night destination of choice for San Francisco food insiders. Reservations are hard to come by, and walk-ins can expect a wait upwards of an hour. Your best bet is to come right when they open at 5 or after 11, but even then waits can be substantial on weekends. Suck it up and snag a seat at the chef's counter in back, where you get front-row seats to the open kitchen. \n \nMeals at NOPA always begin with a simple, seasonal, and delicious amuse-bouche, showcasing the Bay Area's bountiful produce. Then have a close look at the menu: the wine list offers an intriguing selection of lesser-known varietals along with first-rate cocktails, and their salads are not to be missed. More than any other restaurant in San Francisco, NOPA has elevated the salad to an art form, with delightful, inventive, and rigorously seasonal combinations of the best local produce. Their flatbread is another favorite, featuring an ever-changing mix of savory vegetables, cheeses, and meats on a delicate crust baked in their wood-fired oven. Their burger is among the city's best and has satisfied many a late-night craving. While the accompanying fries are excellent, I always substitute them for their roasted broccoli with anchovy and lemon, which will forever change your outlook on vegetables. If you’ve managed not to gorge yourself on their delectable appetizers, try the pot de crème.")
r3 = Restaurant.create(:name => 'Zuni Cafe', :locu_id => '896a8d59b03aca35fc5e', :phone => '4155522522', :opentableurl => 'http://www.opentable.com/zuni-cafe', :url => 'http://www.zunicafe.com', :address => '1658 Market St. San Francisco, CA 94102', :description => "Zuni holds a special place in San Franciscan hearts, at the local sweet spot between casual and elegant, suitable for every occasion as long as you're loaded. The two-story glass wall along Market Street offers amusing if occasionally discomfiting people-watching opportunities, as a mix of deranged homeless people and gays bound for the Castro bars parade by. Once in a while a homeless person will stumble in and for an instant the fourth wall of street life in a capitalist boomtown comes tumbling down, until they are discreetly ushered out by the restaurant's expert staff. \n \nZuni's Caesar salad is the national standard-bearer, and its roast chicken with bread salad is practically an institution. Served with crispy chunks of bread bathed in chicken fat and punctuated by dried currants, pine nuts, and wisps of wild greens, it satisfies like few other dishes in town. The raw bar is extensive, and a meal at Zuni doesn't really feel complete without oysters and champagne. Zuni's burger vies with NOPA for the local fancy-burger crown, but they rather irritatingly decline to serve it between the hours of 6 and 10 owing to its poor margins. It does make for a splendid lunch however. For dessert try the espresso granita, a delightful counterpoint of flavors and textures made with sweetened espresso layered with whipped cream. \n \nDecades after it first opened, a reservation at Zuni is still not easy to come by, but they serve the full menu at the bar tables in the front through the afternoon, so it's great for an afternoon snack.")

I usually start with one of their delicious salads. A crispy combo of arugula, endive, and radicchio in a dynamite lemon vinaigrette topped with shaved Grana Padano, their insalata tricolore is a classic, but keep an eye out for the special salads that rotate through the menu, like the Cuore du Scuro, escarole in a creamy dressing made with cured tuna heart and topped with toasted breadcrumbs, or their salad of orange slices, fennel, and walnuts. When a fritto appears on the menu, order it. Usually made with green beans or favas and served with aïoli, it is rich, delicate, crispy and creamy all at the same time. \n \nThe pizzas are uniformly excellent, and you will have to try them all at some point, but the Funghi pie when it appears is a particular favorite. For dessert try the sgroppino, a grown-up Slushie made with prosecco and house-made seasonal sorbet. \n \nThe 18th St. location, next door to Delfina, is the original, with a slightly more limited menu than California St., which opened a few years later with nearly double the space. They are equally good, and equally busy. Plan on waiting upwards of an hour during prime-time most days; lunch is easier, and if you come early or late you're fine. Takeout service is prompt and a convenient end-run around the wait for tables at prime-time.")

A few years into Quince's reign as my favorite restaurant, the Michelin guide began rating Bay Area restaurants, and, failing to grasp the local gastronomic idiom, gave Chez Panisse and Quince each one star. While Chez Panisse wisely brushed off the slight, Quince gradually took a turn towards the formal French ideal of the guide, instituting a prix-fixe menu, using increasingly elaborate and outlandish presentations, and losing its soul in the process. Quince's transformation was complete once it moved from its discreet, intimate, and elegant digs in Pacific Heights to a bigger, flashier space downtown. \n \nThankfully they opened up Cotogna, a casual café next door where the spirit of the original Quince has been more or less reincarnated. Cotogna’s atmosphere is warm and rustic yet chic, with an open fire in the back roasting meat and a gleaming copper bar. The appetizers always feature a gorgeous salad or two, a quintessentially Californian combination of clean, bright, seasonal flavors, but the better salad-eating angels of my nature are generally overruled when one of their phenomenal frittos is on offer. The pasta is spectacular across the board, but the farm egg raviolo is their signature. A single jumbo raviolo filled with ricotta and a still-runny egg yolk and sauced with brown butter and Parmesan, it is easily the most compelling pasta dish in town. \n \nIt’s a small space and most of the tables are reserved for walk-ins, so reservations are deceptively difficult. If you do a walk-in early or late or go for lunch, you should be fine. The portions are strategically small, so don't be misled by the seemingly moderate prices: you'll want to order several courses, and with drinks (the cocktails are delicious and one leads to another!) you can easily drop upwards of 100 a person. It's kind of a scam but the pasta is so good you won't regret it.")
r7 = Restaurant.create(:name => 'Kokkari', :locu_id => '667ab948001be300a865', :phone => '4159810983', :opentableurl => 'http://www.opentable.com/kokkari-estiatorio', :url => 'http://www.kokkari.com', :address => '200 Jackson St., San Francisco, CA 94111', :description => "The perfect setting for a romantic night out with big fireplaces and wooden beams that give the feel of a cozy inn in Greece, Kokkari and its sister restaurant in Palo Alto, Evvia, have carved out a niche in the Bay Area with their high-end Greek cuisine. A number of tasty appetizers are on offer; the grilled octopus is my favorite. They can usually be counted on to do a delicious seasonal salad, like English peas with cilantro and feta in the spring, or heirloom tomatoes with manouri cheese in the fall. In an unfortunate concession to popular tastes, their classic Greek salad is served with tomatoes year round, but you are welcome to order it when they’re in season. Their lamb chops, served in a refreshing lemon-garlic-oregano vinaigrette with hearty wedges of oven-roasted potatoes, are the gold standard, and beg to be enjoyed with a glass of pinot noir. The whole roasted fish is another favorite, with a choice of fish and preparations that change daily. On a cold, rainy winter night, their moussaka is the ultimate comfort food. I love Kokkari and Evvia, and they do many dishes extraordinarily well, but the menu is not as tightly edited as it could be, so do as you're told and have the lamb chops or the fish and you won't regret it.")

Since it opened in 1971, it has made its mark on menus nationwide, and particularly in San Francisco, where its alumni have gone on to found and staff many of the best restaurants. Decades before 'farm-to-table' was a buzzword, Chez Panisse pioneered the sourcing of local, seasonal, and sustainable ingredients and nurtured the network of farmers and ranchers that have made San Francisco a locavore’s paradise. \n \nChez Panisse is actually divided into two restaurants--a restaurant downstairs with a set menu, and a café upstairs with an à la carte menu. While the restaurant suits special occasions with its more formal atmosphere, the food at the café is equally good, and it's cheaper and easier to book. The café's atmosphere is warm, convivial, and elegant, with posters of Marcel Pagnol's movies featuring the restaurant's namesake character, and enticing displays of fruit that died and went to heaven--in the form of a galette. \n \nWhenever I bring friends to Chez Panisse, I urge them to \"listen to the produce,\" to observe closely the level of vitality and sheer beauty on the plate you will see nowhere else. Here you can count on the very best ingredients with simple, appealing preparations, so I always make a point to try foods I haven't liked previously--for example, sardines, which routinely nauseated me as a child when my dad opened a can for lunch, but at Chez arrived plump and fresh from Monterey Bay with a bracing salsa verde and were astoundingly good. For dessert at the café they always offer whole fresh fruit on a platter, which you really can't pass up. As the waiter explained to us at a recent dinner as we reveled in their transcendent selection of figs and plums, Chez Panisse not only sources its fruit from the best farms--they have the farms select the very best of their fruit, and then a fruit specialist at Chez will evaluate each piece, choosing only those at their peak.")

Years later, the Slanted Door is still one of the hardest restaurants to book in town. Thankfully OTD is just as good and not nearly so competitive. The spring rolls are freshness itself and practically mandatory. I also love the Hue dumplings, sweet and chewy with a tasty mung bean filling. When I have a cold their chicken phô always sets me right and gives me the satisfaction of thinking that somewhere in flyover country at that very instant, someone is facing their cold with a can of Campbell's, and I am not that person.")

As a rule you begin with their bacon beignets served with a maple-chive crème fraîche. I also love their market shots, miniature cocktails that change daily, inspired by the seasons. While many restaurants of this ilk lavish their attention on appetizers, tempting experienced diners to ignore the entrees altogether, at Frances they hold their own. Meat dishes are always succulent and intensely flavorful, with simple yet luscious complements. Likewise, the vegetable side dishes, an afterthought on other menus, are often irresistible here. The lumberjack cake, a dense caramelized cake made with dates, is their signature dessert, but they make a mean fruit galette too. \n \nReservations are basically hopeless, but by all means, if the restaurant gods smile on you and you see the odd table appear on OpenTable at 9 on a Tuesday or whatever, take it. If you arrive 10 minutes or so before they open for a walk-in at the bar, you're probably fine, but at the late end they are often full right up until closing.")
